# Energy Production and CO2 Emissions
## Energy Production Line Plot

The line plots show global versus North American energy production, trade, and supply. The light blue line plot is the total global energy production over time while the dark blue line plot is the total energy production for North America over time. As you can see from the figure, North America accounts for about one quarter of global energy production. Over the years, there has been an increase in energy production.

## CO2 Emissions Bar Graph

The bar graph shows the total worlwide carbon dioxide emissions measured in thousand metric tons. As you can see from the figure, the amount of carbon dioxide emissions is increasing at an increasing rate.
