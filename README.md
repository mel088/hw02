# Threatened Species
## Threatened Species Line Plot

The line plot shows the average number of endangered species in each location from 2004 to 20019. Their numbers in each location are generally increasing over time. I also plotted another line plot to show the trend of the graph. Here is a link to the original data source: http://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_313_201907_Threatened%20Species.csv.

## Threatened Species Scatter Plot

The scatter plot shows the average number of endangered species in each location over the course of 15 years, from 2004 to 2019.
As shown by the graph, there is an upward trend. This means that over time the average number of endangered species in each location is increasing on average. I used a heart symbol for the scatter plot because I love animals. Here is a link to the original data source: http://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB62_313_201907_Threatened%20Species.csv.

My hope is that more people will protect threatened species and, as a result, my plots will eventually start sloping downwards.
